# Ulbora Cart
An open source ecommerce platform server written in golang. Includes admin panel and switchable templates.

This project is intended to be and REST implementation of a hosted ecommerce solution. 

1. Users of the Ulbora Cart, together with Ulbora Cart UI will be able to customize templates just like other hosted solutions.
2. Templates can either be written in Golang templating or use a JavaScript framework like Angular or React.
3. REST services will be used to expose all cart functionality.

## Template Designer
There will also be a template designer to make desiging templates much easier than it currently is with most hosted shopping cart solutions.

1. Users will be able to download there current template
2. Modify the template using the user's store URL
3. Upload the template back to the hosted site

## Database
The default database for Ulbora Cart will be MySQL. The database interface, however will be modular and could easily be switched out for any other database.

## Addon Applications
Ulbora Cart will allow third party developers to build addon applications that integrate into templates.

**We need Golang developers to work on this project.** If you are interested in contributing, send a **pull request** with your name added to the developer section of the readme.
