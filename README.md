# ulboracart
A shopping cart platform written in golang. Includes admin panel and switchable templates.
This project is intended to be and open source implementation of a hosted shopping cart. 


1. Users of the Ulbora Cart will be able to customize templates just like other hosted solutions.
2. Templates can either be written in Golang templating or use a JavaScript framework like Angular or React.
3. REST services will be used to expose all cart functionality.


There will also be a template designer to make desiging templates much easier than it currently is with most hosted shopping cart solutions.

We need Golang developers to work on this project. If you are interested in contributing, send a pull request with your name added to the developer section of the readme.
